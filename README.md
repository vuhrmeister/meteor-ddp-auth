# DDP Authentication

This package is useful if you have one app where your users log in
and one or multiple other apps where you need the user to be
authenticated as well.

The main concept is inspired by https://github.com/ozsay/cluster-accounts
but this package can be used independendly.

> Note: this is the very first version, it isn't even in production yet.
But feel free to use it and contribute to it.
